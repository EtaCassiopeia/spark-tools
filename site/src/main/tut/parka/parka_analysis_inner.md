# Inner Analysis

Inner contains meaningful information about rows with keys on both Datasets.

It contains the number of similar rows and different rows. Also for each different keys the number of difference and a big part of Inner is about comparison between similar rows for each columns.

This comparison contains the number of similar rows and different rows for a particular key and the repartition of both Datasets for this key.
